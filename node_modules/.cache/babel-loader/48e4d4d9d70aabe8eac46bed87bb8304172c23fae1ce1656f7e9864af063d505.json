In this broad area, we pursue two overarching themes,<b>network systems biology </b> and <b>gene regulation via noncoding RNA genes. </b> We are interested in basic biological questions (e.g., the biogenesis of small noncoding RNAs, transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation) and their applications to complex diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and psoriasis) and plant stress response (e.g., rice blast and rice bacterial blight).\n            </li>\n            <li class=\"research_title\">Network-based, allele-specific genome-wide association study (GWAS): </li>\n            <li class=\"research_sentence\">GWAS and single-gene approaches have been popular in identifying risk factors of Mendelian diseases, such as familial Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite a tremendous amount of effort, however, these methods fail to decipher the missing inheritability of complex diseases, such as late-onset AD (or simply AD), diabetes, and psoriasis. A key factor that impairs conventional GWAS on polygenic diseases is the lack of effective ways to identify multiple genomic loci or genes whose interactions or associations underlie the manifestation of disease phenotypes. For example, a brute-force search of possible associations among only three markers within one million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) requires examining a prohibitive number of 1.7×1017 trios. In the Zhang lab, we took a network perspective toward this problem and focused on developing novel enabling techniques for network GWAS. One network GWAS method recently developed in the lab is called BlocBuster (Climer, Templeton and Zhang, PLOS Comp. Biol., 10(9):e1003766, 2014), which exploits the fact that there exist genetic architectures of markers underlying a complex trait. Such architectures are best represented as a network where correlated markers can be regarded as forming network modules or communities. We also used a new similarity measure to accommodate genetic heterogeneity in the population in order to make the network GWAS analysis allele-specific, robust, and rigorous. One application of the network GWAS method to the HapMap population SNPs data revealed a giant 284-SNPs divergent yin-yang haplotype pattern encompassing gephyrin, a gene with remarkably diverse functions related to translation initiation, regulation of synaptic protein synthesis, and mTOR signaling, to name a few (Climer, Templeton and Zhang, Nature Comm., 6:6534, 2015; see the first figure below), suggest a strong positive selection on the region over gephyrin, rapid evolution of world populations, and possible distinct molecular mechanisms involving gephyrin. The discovery of this large yin-yang pattern, which was missed by all existing methods, demonstrates the power of the network GWAS approach. The second application of the network method to GWAS data of psoriasis, an autoimmune skin disorder, helped reveal a module of 17 tightly correlated SNPs within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) on human chromosome 6 (Climer, Templeton and Zhang, PLOS Comp. Biol., 10(9):e1003766, 2014; see also the second figure below). While some of the 17 SNPs have been indicated in previous studies, our result showed that their specific alleles as a whole provide a stronger discriminative power to distinguish psoriasis subjects from normal controls. In short, the Zhang lab is the first to systematically pursue the notion of network GWAS to push the envelopment of conventional GWAS to a new dimension and to develop an effective enabling technique to approach complex disease.</li>\n        </ul>    \n    </div>\n </template>\n\n <script>\n    export default {\n\n    }\n</script>\n\n<style lang=\"less\" scoped>\n</style>"],"mappings":"AAgBI,eAAe,CAEf"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
