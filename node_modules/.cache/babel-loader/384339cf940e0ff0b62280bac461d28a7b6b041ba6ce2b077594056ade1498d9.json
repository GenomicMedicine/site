We aim to find and understand biological “stories” through building models and identifying patterns from large quantities of genome-scale biological data. In the process, we integrate the bench work of molecular biology and develop novel methods and efficient software tools along the way. In this broad area, we pursue two overarching themes,<b>network systems biology </b> and <b>gene regulation via noncoding RNA genes. </b> We are interested in basic biological questions (e.g., the biogenesis of small noncoding RNAs, transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene regulation) and their applications to complex diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and psoriasis) and plant stress response (e.g., rice blast and rice bacterial blight). </li><li class=\\\"research_title\\\">Network-based, allele-specific genome-wide association study (GWAS): </li><li class=\\\"research_sentence\\\">     GWAS and single-gene approaches have been popular in identifying risk factors of Mendelian diseases, such as familial Alzheimer&#39;s disease (AD). Despite a tremendous amount of effort, however, these methods fail to decipher the missing inheritability of complex diseases, such as late-onset AD (or simply AD), diabetes, and psoriasis. A key factor that impairs conventional GWAS on polygenic diseases is the lack of effective ways to identify multiple genomic loci or genes whose interactions or associations underlie the manifestation of disease phenotypes. For example, a brute-force search of possible associations among only three markers within one million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) requires examining a prohibitive number of 1.7×1017 trios. In the Zhang lab, we took a network perspective toward this problem and focused on developing novel enabling techniques for network GWAS. One network GWAS method recently developed in the lab is called BlocBuster (<a class=\\\"research_link\\\" href=\\\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25233071/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Climer, Templeton and Zhang, PLOS Comp. Biol., 10(9):e1003766, 2014</a>), which exploits the fact that there exist genetic architectures of markers underlying a complex trait. Such architectures are best represented as a network where correlated markers can be regarded as forming network modules or communities. We also used a new similarity measure to accommodate genetic heterogeneity in the population in order to make the network GWAS analysis allele-specific, robust, and rigorous. One application of the network GWAS method to the HapMap population SNPs data revealed a giant 284-SNPs divergent yin-yang haplotype pattern encompassing gephyrin, a gene with remarkably diverse functions related to translation initiation, regulation of synaptic protein synthesis, and mTOR signaling, to name a few (<a class=\\\"research_link\\\" href=\\\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25813846/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Climer, Templeton and Zhang, Nature Comm., 6:6534, 2015; see the first figure below</a>), suggest a strong positive selection on the region over gephyrin, rapid evolution of world populations, and possible distinct molecular mechanisms involving gephyrin. The discovery of this large yin-yang pattern, which was missed by all existing methods, demonstrates the power of the network GWAS approach. The second application of the network method to GWAS data of psoriasis, an autoimmune skin disorder, helped reveal a module of 17 tightly correlated SNPs within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) on human chromosome 6 (<a class=\\\"research_link\\\" href=\\\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25233071/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Climer, Templeton and Zhang, PLOS Comp. Biol., 10(9):e1003766, 2014; see also the second figure below</a>). While some of the 17 SNPs have been indicated in previous studies, our result showed that their specific alleles as a whole provide a stronger discriminative power to distinguish psoriasis subjects from normal controls. In short, the Zhang lab is the first to systematically pursue the notion of network GWAS to push the envelopment of conventional GWAS to a new dimension and to develop an effective enabling technique to approach complex disease. </li><li><img class=\\\"research_img\\\" src=\\\"https://genomicmedicine.github.io/site/picture/0/d36267d66cd440de82c75a6cc3909af0.png\\\"></li><li><img class=\\\"research_img\\\" src=\\\"\\thttps://genomicmedicine.github.io/site/picture/0/add660da800f4bf68a2dcf39e87b71bb.png\\\"></li><li class=\\\"research_title\\\">Network-based transcriptome analysis: </li><li class=\\\"research_sentence\\\">     Manifestation of complex diseases or traits is often the result of aberrant gene expression variations in disease states. Analysis of genome-wide gene expression variations, or transcriptome analysis, can thus provide insights into disease mechanisms. In the same vein as network GWAS, the Zhang lab has taken a co-expression network approach to transcriptome analysis of complex diseases by exploiting the rationale of “guilty by association”. One realization of this idea is the HQCut method for constructing and analyzing co-expression networks using gene expression data (Ruan, Dean and Zhang, BMC Syst. Biol., 4:136, 2010; Ruan and Zhang, Physics Review E, 77:016104, 2008). The central piece of the method is a heuristic that combines a spectral clustering technique that maps gene expression data to a latent, lower dimensional space, by which the noise of low information content in the data can be effectively removed. As a result, clustering can be more accurately and efficiently performed. This network transcriptome method has been used in our own research and by many other labs. In particular, using this method, we were able to unravel intricate relationships among co-expressed genes in AD, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases (Ray, Ruan and Zhang, Genome Biol., 9(10):R148, 2008), showing that many genes that are known to be involved in these metabolic diseases were also aberrantly expressed in the AD brain and more interestingly, appeared in one module of co-expressed genes (see the module and genes in yellow in the figure below). This result support the notion that AD is a &quot;diabetes&quot; of the brain. In addition, using this method we identified brain-region specific patterns of gene expression variation in the AD brain (Ray and Zhang, BMC Syst. Biol., 4:136, 2010) and revealed the genetics of gene expression (or eQTL) in AD (Webster, et al., Am. J. Human Genetics, 84(4):445-58, 2009). In short, our work on network biology has clearly demonstrated the power and rigor that computational biology can bring to complex biology problems.</li></ul>\", 1);\nconst _hoisted_3 = [_hoisted_2];\nexport function render(_ctx, _cache, $props, $setup, $data, $options) {\n  return _openBlock(), _createElementBlock(\"div\", _hoisted_1, _hoisted_3);\n}","map":{"version":3,"names":["class","_hoisted_2","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_1","_hoisted_3"],"sources":["/Users/tanghaoyun/Documents/GitHub/WebSiteForLab/web-zhang/src/components/Research/ResearchBiology.vue"],"sourcesContent":["<template>\n    <div class=\"research-content\">\n        <ul>\n            <!-- <li class=\"research_title\">The research projects in the Lab are funded by</li> -->\n            <li class=\"research_sentence\">\n                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The work in the Zhang lab in this broad field is mainly computational and falls into the category of Data Sciences (or Big Data). \n                We aim to find and understand biological “stories” through building models and identifying patterns from large quantities of genome-scale biological data. \n                In the process, we integrate the bench work of molecular biology and develop novel methods and efficient software tools along the way.
