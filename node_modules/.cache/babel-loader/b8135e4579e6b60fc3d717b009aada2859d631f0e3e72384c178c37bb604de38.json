The best-first search (BFS) algorithm, with the well-known A* algorithm as a special case, is time optimal. However, it requires space that is exponential in the search depth of the underlying search tree, which is impractical for large combinatorial optimization problems, such as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). In contrast, a linear-space search (LSS) algorithm, with depth-first search and depth-first branch-and-bound (DFBnB) as special cases, runs linearly in search depth with a penalty of exploring more nodes in the search space. Due to their limited space requirement, LSS algorithms, including DFBnB, iterative deepening A* (IDA*), and recursive best-first search (RBFS), are the most popular techniques for large and difficult search problems in practice. Understanding the expected complexity of LSS algorithms was an important and challenging problem.Based on a random search tree model proposed by Judea Pearl and Richard Karp,<b data-v-4d09866c>our research established the <u data-v-4d09866c>asymptotic optimality</u> of LSS methods</b>, showing that their expected complexity is a constant factor of that of BFS (<a class=\\\"research_link\\\" href=\\\"https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~weixiongzhang/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" data-v-4d09866c>Zhand and Korf, Artificial Intelligence, 79(2):241-92, 1995</a>; <a class=\\\"research_link\\\" href=\\\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4612-1538-7\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" data-v-4d09866c>Zhang, State-Space Search, Springer, 1999</a>).

For the ATSP, the control parameter is the precision of the distances between cities, which is equivalent to the number of digits used to represent distances. Intuitively, when the number of digits used is small, many distances may have a high chance to have the same value, and consequently many complete tours (visiting each and every city exactly once) may have a high chance to have the same cost as well. This also means that a large number of optimal TSP tours exist; and finding one optimal TSP tour should be relatively easy. In contrast, when no two distances between cites are the same, the number of optimal TSP tour is small, so that finding an optimal solution is difficult.
